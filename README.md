## Introduction

This project was done by **[Alaa Ayman](https://github.com/AlaaAymanAbdElRaheem)** and **[Yasmeen Hany](https://github.com/Eileanora)** as a protofilo project for foundations at **ALX Software Engineering Program**.
Although this was done as a protofolio project, we put our heart and soul into making it and we genuinely hope that it will be useful for the people who will use it.

Everything from the design to the code and server configuration and deployment was done by us.

Servers and domain name were provided to us by ALX Software Engineering Program.

## What is SLP Assistant?

SLP Assistant is a website aimed to help **speach and language phasologists** and making their job easier in any way we could.

SLP Assistant offers an easy way to access to the **Integrated Scales of Development** at any time and navigate through it with ease so the SLP will not have to worry about looking up data during each assesment, and focus on the assessment process.

It was all done in the hope to help them in their mission to help as many children as possible

This is the initial version of the project and we are planning on making it better, with more featuers and more user friendly.
